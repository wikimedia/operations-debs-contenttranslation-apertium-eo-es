Esperanto--Spanish
===================================================================

These are the linguistic data for the Apertium Esperanto--Spanish machine translator. 
You need apertium-3.1 and lttoolbox-3.1 to use this translator.
For the es-eo-cg mode (highly recommended!!!) the cg-proc utility is also needed
(see http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/cg3/chunked/index.html and especially chapter 3 "Installation & Updating").

To compile the linguistical data simply do  inside of this directory:

$ ./configure

to generate a Makefile file and then

$ make
# make install


TAGGER

To use this language-pair package with apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the eo-es and the es-eo translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications, and should work even if you change
the dictionaries in a reasonable way.

If for some reason you need to retrain the tagger (for example, you
have made really extensive changes to the dictionaries such as
creating new lexical categories), see the documentation on our wiki
at: http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Tagger_training.
